## <p align="center">TikTok Taking The World By Storm: Where Is Our Entertainment Headed?</p>

Lying in bed, sitting on a chair or sofa, or walking down the street, we keep our fingers scrolling on our phones and
our eyes glued to the screen, unaware of the passing time. Chances are, there is someone around you—perhaps even you—who
engages in this daily routine. In 2025, almost everyone has at least one social media app installed on their
smartphones, pulling them into a virtual world that blends fantasy with reality—or perhaps a real world reflected by a
nonexistent mirror.

Social media platforms include short-form content platforms, with short video platforms being the most prominent. Among
them, TikTok stands out as the most well-known and popular worldwide. By the end of 2024, there were over 170 million
monthly active TikTok users in the United States, making up half of the population (SEO.AI); In China, there were around
766 million monthly active Douyin (TikTok’s counterpart) users, also comprising half of the country's population and
two-thirds of the population with internet access (Thomala, Kemp). Watching short videos on phones for entertainment has
become a widely common and accepted phenomenon in just 4 years, starting in 2018 and taking the world by storm along
with COVID-19 coincidently.

Before the pandemic, the world had already fully entered the information age, particularly the mobile era, where nearly
everyone owned a smartphone. Watching short videos on such a device became as easy as drinking water. During the
pandemic, quarantine measures imposed by many countries forced billions of people to stay at home, isolating them from
the outside world. To get rid of boredom and fulfill social needs, people cast their eyes on social media–and TikTok
emerged as the leading platform.

Beyond the advantages derived from the era, what made TikTok stand out from other contemporary social media platforms?
Its short video format has reshaped the entertainment model since 2020: Instagram has added "Reels," and YouTube has
introduced "Shorts" in response. Research shows that short-form videos are extremely addictive, delivering instant joy
and satisfaction that keep users hooked. TikTok’s algorithm is also incredibly powerful, with its “For You” page
ensuring deep user engagement. (Qin, Omar, and Musetti) There are endless videos, and almost all of them are tailored to
your interests.

It is true that TikTok initially brought mostly positive content to users, creating a new form of entertainment and
drawing everyone into it. People can view the Alps and Niagara Falls without leaving their homes, enjoy funny videos and
share them with friends, and even create their own content to become influencers. TikTok fosters communities based on
shared interests and gradually becomes the daily topic of social discourse. However, those who assume TikTok has more
positive than negative impacts overlook a crucial point: all the joy and positive influences it brings—entertainment,
knowledge, and news—are also available on YouTube. Long-form videos can deliver everything short videos offer in terms
of positive sides since they are both streaming videos by nature. What sets short videos apart, however, are their
inherently negative natures.

I conducted a survey of 78 participants, including Chinese college students, middle-aged Chinese adults, international
college students at UC Santa Barbara, and American adults living in Santa Barbara. This diverse sample includes both
young people and adults, as well as individuals from different cultural backgrounds, reducing bias to some extent. The
data reveals a clear trend: only 20 percent of respondents feel they can fully control themselves when watching short
videos, while nearly 40 percent admit they often find it difficult to stop scrolling. This stark contrast highlights the
extremely addictive nature of TikTok, making people stick to its virtual world. However, every era has had its own
addictive forms of entertainment, just to different extents, from novels to radio, from television to video games, and
from long-form videos to short-form videos. The real concern, therefore, goes far beyond entertainment; it lies in the
content amplified and spread by TikTok.

Based on my survey, nearly 90 percent of respondents at least occasionally encounter videos or comments related to fake
news, online quarrels, or deliberate criticism, with 35 percent seeing such content frequently. About half report that
their moods are negatively affected when exposed to these types of content, yet 80 percent quickly forget about them,
not retaining them in their long-term memory. These results suggest that negative content is now widespread in the
information ocean, contributing to various social issues while most of us notice its presence but remain indifferent.

First of all, fake news submerges the truth, polarizing people to an extreme extent. This is evident in the widening
divide between Democrat and Republican supporters in American politics and the polarization between fervent nationalism
and deliberate defamation in Chinese patriotic discourse. Second, online conflicts escalate much more easily than
real-world disputes since there are no immediate consequences or punishments, turning the Internet into a chaotic and
lawless battleground. Beyond social tensions, short videos also negatively impact mental well-being. They amplify
stress, anger, frustration, and hostility, particularly among teenagers who lack emotional maturity and critical
judgment. This extends to physical health and self-perception—many young viewers, bombarded with idealized beauty
standards, may develop unhealthy eating habits in an attempt to match the unrealistic appearances they see on screen.
Lastly, TikTok’s ultra-low barrier to content creation is unprecedented. Anyone can upload anything, leading to an
overwhelming flood of low-quality and often meaningless content, further diluting valuable and insightful discourse.

Given these overwhelming negative influences, one of the most controversial issues of our time arises: Should we ban
TikTok and other short-video social media platforms? Despite all the negative impacts I have demonstrated, my answer is
“NO”—we cannot and should not. History cannot be reversed. Why? At the end of my survey, I posed an open-ended question:
_If all social media platforms disappeared tomorrow, how would you feel? What would you do for entertainment instead?_
The responses vary–some feel sad, some feel great, and some feel nothing–but the similarities in their alternative
entertainment choices are astonishing. Many respondents mention exercising (sports, fitness), traveling, reading books,
studying, and hanging out with friends, expressing a belief that they would engage in more meaningful and positive
real-life activities, just like the times before social media existed. However, I am confident in asserting that this
vision is somewhat idealistic, for people tend to imagine scenarios in a way that aligns more with what they wish to
happen rather than what is likely to happen. As a result, such scenarios would only occur for those already inclined
toward them. Yet, still, some respondents provided particularly realistic answers, admitting they would probably just
switch to watching TV, playing video games, or even having sexual lives.

In Amusing Ourselves to Death (1985), Neil Postman suggested that human entertainment would become increasingly
fragmented, meaningless, and addictive. (Postman) Our history of content entertainment has progressed through printed
books, newspapers, radio, film, television, video games, and now, social media and short videos. If social media were to
disappear, it would be nothing but history rewind to the era of television and video games. But looking back at the
20<sup>th</sup> century, was everyone doing meaningful things instead of sitting on the couch watching TV? Furthermore,
we would not simply be going back to the era of television; instead, we would devote ourselves to seeking newer,
flashier, and even more addictive forms of entertainment, just as we are now in the era of social media, where
television has almost faded away.

In this case, what will be our next entertainment? The future remains unpredictable since humans are confined to the era
they live in, just as we once could not foresee what would come after television, but we can still make some bold
guesses: it might be an AI-driven era where music, art, and videos are mass-produced without human creativity, making
them feel even more hollow. Meanwhile, AR and VR technology could further heighten sensory and neural stimulation,
expanding beyond sight and sound to potentially incorporate smell, taste, and touch—immersing people even further and
deepening our addiction to virtual entertainment.

Freedom and democracy always come at the cost of uncertainty and lack of protection. Entertainment capitalism will only
grow more and more uncontrolled. History has shown that there is no general solution, but everyone has the free right to
resist being devoured by entertainment and remain conscious, to take control of their own destiny.
